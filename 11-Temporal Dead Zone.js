//* Temporal Dead Zone

// The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable withthe let and const keywords, but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a let or constvariable before its declaration (within its scope) causes a ReferenceError. The time span when that happens, between the creation of a variableâ€™s binding and its declaration, is called thetemporal dead zone

function somemethod() {
  console.log(counter1); // undefined
  console.log(counter2); // ReferenceError
  var counter1 = 1;
  let counter2 = 2;
}
somemethod();
